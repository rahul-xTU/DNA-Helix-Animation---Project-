# DNA-Helix-Animation---Project-
This project creates a rotating DNA double helix animation in the terminal using ASCII art. I chose this project because I wanted to learn Python animation while visualizing something from biology that I found interesting. The program shows how DNA's famous spiral structure looks and demonstrates the random pairing of nucleotides.
